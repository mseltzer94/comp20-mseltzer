- Correctly loads a data.json from the server
- Displays within Mesages tag in HTML

Question Response: 
Javascript does not allow for data access to another server or to the local 
in order to prevent security and duplicate naming risks. For example, it 
would be problematic if a users data could be accessed from a remote server
or if the remote server requested data from another server in the javascript
code itself.
