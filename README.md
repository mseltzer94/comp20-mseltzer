Comp 20 - Web Programming 

* Purpose : 
	- Repository of works for Comp 20
		course. Based on assignments provided
		by Ming Chow (https://github.com/mchow01).
* Favorite Assignment:
	- Assignment 2 : MMAP
		MMAP showed the use of the Google API
		and location tools to submit requests to 
		a server and then dynamically display
		results of people's locations on a
		map. This was interesting as it
		showed that an interesting and
		useful tool can be built using API's
		with relative ease (and in little time)
		because the API's allow for the developer
		to not have to reinvent the wheel. 
* Growth:
	- Comp 20 has shown be the wide scope
		of available tools and shown me
		that javascript and other tools
		such as angular js allow for 
		extremely powerful tools to be 
		created. The sheer amount of tools
		available for web dev is astonishing
		but Comp 20 has allowed me to be 
		more comfortable in starting
		to use a tool that I haven't used 
		previously.
* Important Lessons
	- Don't reinvent the wheel
		Assignment 2 MMAP showed that
		API's are essential for quick
		web development and creating 
		tools that are truly new/different.
	- Be extremely careful with formatting work
		Although there are great tools for debugging
		web dev apps, debugging code that is
		clean and well indented makes a huge difference.
		Writing clean code > comments
* Future topics
	- Asynchronous callbacks - I want to really understand
		how these works, and how Javascript truly handles 
		the calls such as "onreadystatechange".
